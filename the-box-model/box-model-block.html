    <!-- The example below has three different HTML elements, all of which have an outer display type of block.

    A paragraph with a border added in CSS. The browser renders this as a block box. 
    The paragraph starts on a new line and extends the entire available width.

    A list, which is laid out using display: flex. 
    This establishes flex layout for the children of the container, which are flex items. 
    The list itself is a block box and — like the paragraph — expands 
    to the full container width and breaks onto a new line.

    A block-level paragraph, inside which are two <span> elements. 
    These elements would normally be inline, however, 
    one of the elements has a class of "block" which gets set to display: block.
