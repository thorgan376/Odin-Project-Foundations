    <!-- In the next example, we can see how inline elements behave.

    The <span> elements in the first paragraph are inline by default 
    and so do not force line breaks.

    The <ul> element that is set to display: inline-flex creates an inline box 
    containing some flex items.

    The two paragraphs are both set to display: inline. 
    The inline flex container and paragraphs all run together on one line 
    rather than breaking onto new lines (as they would do if they were displaying as block-level elements).

    To toggle between the display modes, you can change display: inline to display: block or display: inline-flex to display: flex. -->

    <p>Example 2:</p>
    <p>
      I am a paragraph. Some of the
      <span>words</span> have been wrapped in a <span>span element</span>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Item One</li>
      <li>Item Two</li>
      <li>Item Three</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="inline">I am a paragraph. A short one.</p>
    <p class="inline">I am another paragraph. Also a short one.</p>
  </body>
